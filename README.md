Code for suspensions in Newtonian and biviscous matrices with a lubrication dynamics model.

 This code has been developed  in collaboration between
  - Marco Ellero, leader of  the CFD  Modelling and Simulation  group at  BCAM (Basque
    Center  for  Applied  Mathematics)  in  Bilbao,  Spain.
  - Adolfo Vazquez-Quesada from the Department  of Fundamental Physics at UNED,
    in Madrid, Spain.

Code  for  simulating  suspensions  of  spherical  particles  in  a
   Newtonian  or biviscous  fluid. The  hydrodynamic interactions  are
   modeled through lubrication  forces, so the code is  expected to be
   valid only for concentrated systems.
